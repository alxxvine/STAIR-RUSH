# Stair Rush

A simple, fast-paced game about climbing a treacherous tower, one risky jump at a time.

## Core Mechanics
- Procedurally generated infinite stairs.
- Single jump (LMB) to advance one step.
- Double jump (RMB) to skip a step, moving further and faster.
- Dynamic camera that follows the player's ascent.
- Physics-based jumping for a "game feel" approach.
